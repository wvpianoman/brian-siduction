# brian-mx

 This is my personal MX Linux installation/maintenance scripts.

 This fits my personal use-case, and might not be compatible with yours.

 I have taken inspiration from my brother from another mother, Tolga Erok

 You can find his GitHub here   https://github.com/tolgaerok

 He has collections available for NixOS, Debian and Fedora.
